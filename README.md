# Welcome to our site

This Readme will contain information and links to information on LandingPad and Penfolio

## Our Vision

Our project provides a web application called LandingPad that centralizes bringing multiple social media platforms into one place. Unlike Hootsuite and Everypost that offer a similar package, LandingPad will display all news feeds on a single page format. Users will also be able to edit how they prefer to view their newsfeed, from endless scroll feed to next page formatting. Another one of these features include a writing platform, that allows writers to create, share, and receive feedback from friends which diverges from apps like Wattpad and Medium. Finally, users will be able to create a customizable experience by modifying options for profiles, connections, and display. LandingPad will save users time to catch up on all their news feeds on the most popular social media sites.

## Our Motto

Back to the basics until we get it right!
