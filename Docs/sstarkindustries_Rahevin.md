## Vision Statement
For prospective college students who want to be able to search for colleges based on set criteria and see if both the college, and its city, are right for them. The College Tour Guide is an information system that will allow the user to fill out a form of set criteria, hold a search based on that criteria and get back a list of results with the best match on top. They can then look over various details of these results, such as information about the city amenities, travel options or demographics. It will then run comparisons of the data to find the best matches. Unlike the current websites, such as Naviance Student or ACT College Search, the focus is on the social, economic and psychological needs of the student being met, not their test scores.

### Testing Accounts (Not Necessary)

### Any other info needed for testing
The search based on college criteria is not yet implemented as a feature so Lifestyle results are based on manually entered data at this time.
Also, to run the front page search you must select the "College Companion" top link to get the right domain. This is a known bug we still can't fix yet.

__[Error in College Search]__
  Include:
  
    1. When display all the colleges from oregon, I selected the heart icon on one of the colleges.
    2. Steps: Go to search for colleges, Enter in Oregon, Select the heart icon on any of the returned results, redirects to error page, that states "the resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable"
    3. Actual Result: Error page that redirects due to temporarily unavaible
    4. Expected Result: Unsure, assuming this is a save feature.
    5. I'm guessing because I was not logged in or created an account this error had occured. 
    
    
Most importantly: __be specific!__

__[SearchesMenu Page]__ When clicking on one of the three tab, the text behaves oddly before settling down.

__[Recommendation]__ On your about page I would either darken the text or background of the text. Its a little hard to read.

__[ShoutOut]__ I like the colors and images used in your website.
