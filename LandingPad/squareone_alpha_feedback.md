__[ShoutOut]__ 10/10 I like that all group members did testing together. 

Complete and accurates tests. Nice catch on breaking into the site as an unknown users. By far the most comprehensive information from anyone. Could have listed specifics on accounts used or browser information. Good catch on images not working in the editor.
